            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The natural beginning of al growing &amp; liuing things, is heate,<note place="margin">Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal heate not in acte.</note> gods ordinary instrumƒìt, (as <hi>Hip.</hi> testifieth, <hi>lib. de car.</hi> which we cal Elemental, &amp; this heate with moist colde and dryth, frameth our parts: I say this, taking the elementall force for the whole Element, as if I should say, following him worthely as prince and cheife leader in all naturall and phisicall causes, that the elementes what, colde, moiste and drye, doth constitute our bodies. But because this heate is not in act, as <hi>Fal.</hi> affirmeth, <hi>li. de cal.</hi> it cannot be touched or felt, albeit deuisible in the compounds, that is although it be, it cannot be knowne by any sensible reason.</p>

And yet if you compare the heate in liuing bodyes to Fyer, the breath to Aire, the fleshe hard parts to Earth, and the moist to Water, as <hi>Galen</hi> sheweth, <hi>1. de Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis,</hi> you shal finde a great resemblaunce of the second Elements.

            <p>This is that heate which maketh our temperature with the other Elaments: for onely heate tastes of the nature of lyfe as <hi>Fernelius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Lib de spir. et in nat calido.</hi> And therfore hath the reason of couiting and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We haue a nother heate called naturall, which is knowen by sense as the vnuaturall also. For ther is no man if he will feele that may not easely perceaue heate in all liuing creatures, growing or not growing,<note place="margin">Naturall heate is in acte.</note> albeit it is found differing in degree, in some it is strong, in some slacke, in some it is knowne rather by reason then by sense.</p>
            <p>Some haue it most strong as Lions, some weake as fishes, some more slacke as plants. Of which some men might doubt, yet we can, following <hi>Ga. fal.</hi> althogh very hardly attaine it by sense. Neuerthelesse we know it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the effectes, reason, and authoritie of wryters. That it may be knowne by sense, it may be proued in the Winter season,<note place="margin">Sense iudge of heate in plantes.</note> if you cut a Tr√©e about the partes next to the ground, the heate may be perceiued. Further more, if Snow fall, that part of Snow about the tr√©e is first melted, &amp; this is through heate being in the plantes in acte.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we s√©e in plants such effects as we s√©e in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, and those be the effects of heate, we s√©e they swel, grow, and are nourished, therefore that heate is present, which thing is confirmed by the authoritie of <hi>Theophrastus primo causis plant.</hi> testifying in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, that naturall heate is found in plantes, and growing things, and he calleth it the heate of the seede naturall, <hi>Aristot.</hi> proper heate, <hi>primo metheor.

<pb facs="tcp:178492:6"/>&amp; implanted heate. <hi>1.2. de sacult.</hi> of vs (not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improperly) life, and that is it of which we nowe speake.</p>
            <p>But we haue our first heate of Elements, and whence haue we this naturall, either of seede, or else of blood by which sperme is nourished,<note place="margin">Naturall heate whence.</note> or else of the womb in which liuing creatures are engendred. And therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led generatiue, naturall, and proper, bicause it is in the beginning of generation and matter of sperme, as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> very learnedly sheweth, <hi>De hominis proc lib. 7.</hi> But the creatures engendred of egges, whence haue they it? of the egge heated of the heare of the damme, or by some arte? and that young ones are hatched of egges heated in an Ouen, or by heate of doung, or sande: it is dayly proued, especially of those which trauaile to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> Neither ought this to seeme meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, seing we s√©e infinite creatures breede of egges, and otherwise,<note place="margin">Briede without damme.</note> vpon which the dammes doe not sit, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, but they grow only by rottennes as do Snailes euery wher, yeles in muddy diches, Bernacles in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Mise in <hi>Libia,</hi> and diuers other sorts by the Riuer of <hi>Nile,</hi> as <hi>Plime</hi> testifieth in <hi>Histo.</hi> and <hi>Cardanus in lib. de rerum var.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, plantes or growing things haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this heate, through seede heated of the earth. For when as the earth waxeth hote by <hi>Antiparistasis,</hi> &amp; by light shining &amp; mouing of the plants,<note place="margin">Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heate cause of earthelie increase.</note> it giueth heate to the seede, and the seede to the plants, and thereof rose that Astronomicall &amp; Philosophicall saying of <hi>Ptol.</hi> and <hi>Aristot.</hi> that is, that al inferiour things are ruled by the superiour, and that the Sonne and Moone engendreth man. This is therfore the beginning of this heat, which hath these conditions and properties, that it may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, flow, slyde &amp; be dispersed, wherfore it must haue a cause alwayes preseruing, which failing, lyfe must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. In plants it is kept of the heate of the earth, which in those places is hote: But it may be demaunded how
<pb facs="tcp:178492:6"/>can the earth, of it selfe colde, communicate heate to the plants? seeing we haue proued in our second booke of <hi>Bathes ayde,</hi> that it cannot giue that actuall heate to the waters of Bathes, that it should make them hote. The earth truely waxeth warme accidƒìtally, not naturally, nor actually, neither potentially, but either by the heate of the Sonne, and starres reflected, or else through their mouing, heating, and therefore the Sommer is hote by reason of the beames of the Sonne which fall directly vppon vs, as affirmeth <hi>Mont. lib. de sa. tu.</hi> How be if Auicen attributeth more heate to the tariaunce,<note place="margin">why the f≈çmer is whote.</note> then to the direction in. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; <hi>2.</hi> But wher the nerenes, direction &amp; tariaunce is greatest, ther no doubt is most heate, as in <hi>Hispame;</hi> &amp; Affricke, the same also yearely in this clime we proue, for in Iuly, August, and September, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Sonne commeth not only nearer vs, but also bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as then it is of good tariaunce, the season is hoter then April, Maye, and Iune, which be of as long course and rather longer and directer, but not so neare. And yet in October, Nouember &amp; December, although it be then nearest, as in the opposite of his axell, by reason the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode is so smal a while, and the beames laterally cast, it is then more colde. All the which approue aswel by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and authoritie as by experience, the hot season to grow of all the thr√©e aforesayde causes concurring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not of one onely. Notwithstanding we must know, that the Sonne hath not his heate in acte which it sendeth to the lower parts, for it is not Elemental,<note place="margin">The son hath not his heat in acte.</note> but by reason of the rowling of the Sonne and Starres: for all mouing is heating, as affirmeth Aristot. <hi>lib 2. de calo et mundo et. 1. met.</hi> Neuertheles it heateth &amp; that <hi>per. fe.</hi> of it selfe, as <hi>Mont.</hi> auoucheth, <hi>lib. de sal. tut.</hi>

            <p>Againe, if the naturall heate be encreased by a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry augementation, this encrease dothe sone consume the subiecte, as <hi>Galen</hi> testifyeth, <hi>Lib. de inequal. int. et. 1. de Differ. feb.</hi> And therefore the augementati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is sayde to be contrarye to the naturall heate, aswell by reason of the agent, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ende.<note place="margin">As natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heate is cause of life, so the vnna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall is cause of death.</note> And that made <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> to saye, that the heate which made the body, doth kill it, in <hi>Epid.</hi> vnto this also <hi>Fernelius,</hi> doth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe. <hi>Lib. de spir. et inuat. calid.</hi> either bicause as the vitall heate dothe cherishe all the faculties, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, by reason of this encrease they are weakened, corrupted, and wasted: and by this reason it is called contrary to the naturall heate.</p>
            <p>This is confirmed both by the authoritie of Aristotle <hi>4. meteor.</hi> and of <hi>Galen.</hi> 5. <hi>simpt.</hi> and also by experience.

            <p>And this augmentation although it excede the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate in degr√©e, yet it hurteth it not, but increaseth and helpeth it to execute his faculties, functions, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. Wherfore, right Honorable, consider well this one thing which is of great force to take away many douts? for when we saye that the naturall heate is hot as fyre and that the body is heated or cooled,<note place="margin">Actuall heate. Actuall colde.</note> and by heate do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande actuall heate, and by colde actuall colde, that is not distemperature of the parts, it is one thing that hea is encreased in degr√©e, it is a nother thing hotte distem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perature:
<pb facs="tcp:178492:14"/>temperature is not in acte, I know that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities be to the contrarie, saith <hi>Fallop.</hi> Yet whot distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature accounted of Phisitions is not heate increased aboue the degr√©e. For we vnderstande by it, as when a synew is sayd to be gr√©ened, bicause more heate is brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght vnto it, either by reason of nourishment hote and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (and heare is more fier lying hid) or else bicause the finewe is made hot by an outward part hot, which is the cause that the fiery Element receiueth greater force, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be qualyfied, corrected and restrayned.</p>
            <p>And this is distemperature without matter, with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when the Element is mingled with coler and bloud mingled in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> parts, as the firy and bloudy Apostemes dai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to well declareth.</p>
            <p>But one may say, when a parte is gr√©ened through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature hot in acte, why is it whoter then if it wer not gr√©ened? if this your temperature do not lye open to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> iudgment of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sences. You must know that this actual heat hath his subiect the spirits: which is continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> oyly or vnctuous matter of which all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick partes do c≈çsist, skin, sinews, gristles, bones &amp;c. As in our tables of the things naturall, where we haue deuided them from the sanguin may appeare.</p>
            <p>This vnctuous matter hath the same mixtion which the bone, sinewe, and all other partes haue.</p>
            <p>If this spirit do result from the sinew it is dryer sayth <hi>Fallop</hi> and ayrier, and by consequence more drye, that if it wer not a sinew of colde distemperature as <hi>Galen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth <hi>lib. 1. de tempa. et 2. Flement.</hi>

            <p>Hence it is that man s√©emeth somewhat hotte bicause his spirit is drye and ayrie and by consequence the heat conceiued, s√©enieth greater thƒì in a child,<note place="margin">A dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of heate in euery part.</note> for in it y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> heate is moister and plesanter, in a yong man dryer, and shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as <hi>Galen</hi> expresseth <hi>lib. 2. de temper.</hi> and therfore in euery parte we haue a double encrease of heate, that is Elementall, and naturall, actuall, Elemental which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb facs="tcp:178492:15"/>distemperature, actuall following distemperature.</p>
            <p>The same I say of colde matter, &amp; hence it is that the parts s√©eme cold because they haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most moist oylines in which stronge heate and feruente can not b√©e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.</p>
            <p>You haue therefore what is ment by distemperature, what by elementall heate, what by naturall, and what by that which is contrary to nature.</p>
            <p>These heates if you remember what is discoursed of them, you may easely perceiue their operation &amp; in what sort they worke,<note place="margin">The ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration of naturall heate.</note> &amp; especially the natural in the bodies of growing and liuing creatures, but chiefely of thƒì which are gouerned by vnderstanding, voyde of errour, it hath this operation, that it maye change the subiect moysture suffering alteration, &amp; doth worke vppon it as on a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect altering, the one ende of this action and passion, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; suffering, is transmutation which the philosopher, calleth perfection.<note place="margin">Concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note> And <hi>Gal.</hi> defineth it to be the alterati≈ç of the nurishmƒìt in to the qualitie of the nourished. <hi>1. et. 3 de nat. facult.</hi> vnto the which also <hi>Fernel.</hi> doth consent, de <hi>animae facult.

            </p>
            <p>But what is this perfecti≈ç? I say it is only one, albeit ther be more c≈çcoccions &amp; alterati≈çs <hi>analogicalli</hi> spokƒì.

So the minister hereof (Gods instrument,) is naturall or temperate heate. And it shalbe no errour for to say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the partes shall or do engender like them selues, &amp; that the naturall heate engendreth the partes,</p>

            <p>The second alteration is partly good, partly euell, good bicause it is made of the naturall heate, bad, bicause it is made of heate vnnaturall thereunto annexed, good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it endeth in a s√©edy qualitie, euel bicause it is made of some parte corrupted.</p>
            <p>The third alteration is made of an euell worker in any euell matter, when the humor is rotten and is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by rotten heate.
